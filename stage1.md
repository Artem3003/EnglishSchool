# Designing a REST API and its implementation

## Objective.

2. Within the chosen or provided subject area, you should independently identifie at least two entities and their properties.

3. For the identified entities, design and implement a web REST API that provides operations for working with these entities. You can use any of the approaches to API design: “contract first” or “code first”.

4. The designed and implemented REST API must necessarily provide the following operations for each entity: getting a list of all entities, getting a specific entity by its identifier, adding a new entity, update an existing entity, delete an entity. 

## Software requirements

1. To implement the software during the execution of the computer any stack (programming language, web framework, etc.) technologies.

2. The software implemented during the computer software implemented during the computer workshop should not use persistent storage (database) for to store entities. Simple storage of entities in memory or in text files is allowed.

3. The implemented software must provide Swagger interface (or equivalent) for visualization and work with the implemented REST API.
