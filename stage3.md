# Additional features of server-side web applications

## Objective.

Gain skills in working with additional features of server web applications, such as configuration, caching, and logging.

## Tasks.

Add to the server web application implemented during the first and the second works of the computer workshop, the following functionalities:
1. Logging (for example, when calling the repository methods implemented in
during the second work of the computer workshop).
2. Caching for those API operations where appropriate.
3. Working with configuration, which should also affect the behavior of the REST API
(implementing a “technical” configuration, such as logging level or string
database connection string is not enough).
